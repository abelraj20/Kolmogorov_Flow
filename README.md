In this repository, Kolmogorov flow (or k-flow) is studied and simulated in a laboratory environment. A.N. Kolmogorov developed the so-called Kolmogorov flow towards the end 
of the 1950s by turning his attention to the study of two-dimensional incompressible flows with a particularly high wavenumber. In two-dimensional, incompressible flows, fluid 
instability arises due to a sinusoidal mean velocity profile induced by external forcing. Kolmogorov flow specifically manifests as a unidirectional shear flow exhibiting such 
a sinusoidal mean velocity profile.

The setup involved the arrangement of magnets parallel under a tray, with a two-centimeter gap between them (11 x 7 format), alternating in polarity. The UV light sources were 
disassembled to attain the LEDs and the circuit themselves, passing the voltage of the batteries. They were housed in a custom 3D-printed box for safe use. A solution of 
copper sulfate and water was then poured into the tray which took up 30.8% of the plastic container and had a volume of 5.598±0.194 × 10^−4 m^3. Copper electrodes were 
securely mounted on opposite sides of the tray and submerged in the solution. This link allowed current to flow through the water from the voltage supply which aids the 
creation of the homogeneous and isotropic way the fluid flows. Fluorescent beads with a diameter of 157 μm and 5% CV were used to distinguish the flow patterns.

Visualisations were coded to show unfiltered (t1) and filtered (t2) graphs. Visualisations of the Langrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) for the k-flow in laminar, unstable and 
turbulent states were coded. Furthermore, visualisations of the Reynolds number using Least Squared Fitting (LSF) and vorticity were also produced.
